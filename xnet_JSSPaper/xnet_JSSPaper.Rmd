abstract: >
  This paper presents the R package \pkg{xnet} for cross-network analysis of bipartite networks, using two-step kernel ridge regression. It uses the crossvalidation shortcuts proposed by @stock2018 to allow for computationally efficient evaluation of the models based on a variety of leave-one-out methods. The package provides functions for easy tuning, fitting and evaluation of two-step kernel ridge regression in the context of cross-network analysis. We illustrate the use of the \pkg{xnet} package with datasets from different areas of research.

# Introduction

This template demonstrates some of the basic latex you'll need to know to create a JSS article.

## Code formatting

Don't use markdown, instead use the more precise latex commands:

* \proglang{Java}
* \pkg{plyr}
* \code{print("abc")}

# R code

Can be inserted in regular R markdown blocks.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```
