function) that calculates the loss. See also \code{\link{tune}} and

An object of the class permtest.

\description{
This function does a permutation-based evaluation of the impact of
different edges on the final result. It does so by permuting the kernel
matrices, refitting the model and calculating a loss function.
}
\details{
The test involved uses a normal approximation. It assumes that under the
null hypothesis, the loss values are approximately normally distributed.
The cumulative probability of a loss as small or smaller than
the one found in the original model, is calculated based on a normal
distribution from which the mean and sd are calculated from the permutations.
}
\section{Warning}{
 It should be noted that this normal approximation is an ad-hoc approach.
There's no guarantee that the actual distribution of the loss under the
null hypothesis is normal. Depending on the loss function, a significant
deviation from the theoretic distribution can exist. Hence it should only
be used as a rough guidance in model evaluation.
