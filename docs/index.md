The package `xnet` is a package in development for cross-network analysis
like protein-ligand or plant-pollinator interactions. Currently the
package provides a basic interface for two-step kernel ridge regression,
including quick crossvalidation due to mathematical optimalizations.

The package is still in beta, so expect thorough changes and additions.
